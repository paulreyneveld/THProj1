# TH Project 1

This project was built to satisfy the requirements of the first Treehouse FSJS Tech Degree project. 

My goal was to use vanilla JS to randomly display a quote from an array on the page. At an interval, the page will refresh with a 
new quote if the user doesn't choose to update the page by interacting with it first.
